# Training App - Project Overview

## Project Description

The Training App is a comprehensive fitness and exercise tracking platform designed to help users manage their workout routines, track exercises, and monitor their fitness progress. The project consists of a robust backend API built with Rust and a modern mobile application developed with Flutter.

## Architecture Overview

### Backend (Rust + PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)
- **Framework**: Rust with Axum web framework for high-performance API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for time-series sensor data
- **Authentication**: JWT-based stateless authentication with access/refresh tokens
- **Security**: Argon2id password hashing and comprehensive input validation
- **Data Model**: Exercise-first design where exercises are independent entities

### Frontend (Flutter Mobile App)
- **Framework**: Flutter with Dart for cross-platform mobile development
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for clean, reactive state management
- **UI/UX**: Material Design 3 with custom theming and responsive design
- **API Integration**: Dio HTTP client with automatic token management
- **Storage**: Flutter Secure Storage for credential management

## Core Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication System
- User registration and login with email/password
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Secure credential storage on mobile devices
- Session persistence and automatic logout

### üèãÔ∏è Exercise Type Management
- Create custom exercise types with flexible metadata schemas
- JSON Schema validation for exercise-specific data fields
- Category-based organization (Strength, Cardio, Flexibility, etc.)
- Global and user-defined exercise types
- Dynamic form generation based on exercise type schemas

### üí™ Exercise Management
- Full CRUD operations for individual exercises
- Dynamic exercise creation forms that adapt to selected exercise type
- Metadata validation and type conversion (text, numbers, booleans)
- Filtering by category and exercise type
- Detailed exercise views with all associated data

### üì± Mobile Application Features
- Cross-platform Flutter app (Android/iOS)
- Intuitive navigation with bottom tab bar
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and offline-friendly design
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Design
- PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints
- TimescaleDB hypertables for sensor data (prepared for future use)
- Soft deletion pattern for data recovery
- Comprehensive migration system
- Seed data for global exercise types

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Data models with JSON serialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/      # State management with Provider pattern
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # API client and service layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/        # UI screens and user interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/        # Reusable UI components
```

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Exercise-First Design**: Exercises can exist independently without workouts
2. **JSON Schema Validation**: Exercise types define custom metadata validation
3. **Stateless Authentication**: JWT tokens for scalable authentication
4. **Soft Deletes**: All entities support recovery with deleted_at timestamps
5. **Type-Safe API**: Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get current user profile

### Exercise Types
- `GET /exercise-types` - List available exercise types
- `POST /exercise-types` - Create custom exercise type
- `GET /exercise-types/:id` - Get exercise type details
- `PATCH /exercise-types/:id` - Update exercise type
- `DELETE /exercise-types/:id` - Delete exercise type

### Exercises
- `GET /exercises` - List exercises with filtering
- `POST /exercises` - Create new exercise
- `GET /exercises/:id` - Get exercise details
- `PATCH /exercises/:id` - Update exercise
- `DELETE /exercises/:id` - Delete exercise

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users**: User accounts with encrypted passwords
- **exercise_types**: Exercise categories with JSON schema definitions
- **exercises**: Individual exercise entries with metadata
- **sensor_timeseries**: TimescaleDB hypertable for sensor data (prepared)

### Relationships
- Users can create custom exercise types (in addition to global ones)
- Exercises belong to exercise types and inherit their metadata schema
- All entities support soft deletion for data recovery
